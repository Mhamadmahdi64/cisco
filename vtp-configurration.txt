1- configure the basic conf to the devices :
a-hostname IT-Department ( you can chose any name u want )
b-line console 0
   password cisco@123 ( you can chose any pass u want )
   login
   exec-timeout 3 0 ( exit timeout after 3 minutes and zero second )
   logging synchronous
c- vty password :
    line vty 0 4 
    password cisco@123 ( you can chose any pass u want )
    login
    exec-timeout 3 0 ( exit timeout after 3 minutes and zero second )
    logging synchronous
d-banner motd # this switch is for it department # ( you can put any msgs u want )
e- no ip domain lookup 

2-config vtp for vlan in switches : 
en
conf t
vtp domain gtech
vtp mode server ( make the switch as a vtp server )
do wr
3-config vlan into vtp server :( in this ex will make it department as vtp mode server and the other switches as vtp mode client )
vlan 10 
name IT ( name the vlan 10 as IT )
vlan 20
name Research
vlan 30
name Electrical
vlan 40 
name Marketing
vlan 50 
name Accounting
vlan 60 
name Finance
vlan 70
name Logistic
vlan 80 
name Customer
do wr
do show vlan ( to show vlan configure into switch )
4-conf other switches as client :
vtp domain gtech
vtp mode client 
do wr
5- enable trunk mode interfaces for switches :
conf t
int range fa0/1-2
switchport mode trunk
do wr
6- enable trunk in switchlayer3 :
en
conf t
int range gigabitethernet1/0/1-24
switchport mode trunk
do wr
7-now we can add any vlan in the VTP mode server ( it -department on this case ) and we can see it om all switches
8-vtp pruning ( allow and denied vlan in ports)
en
conf t
int range FA0/1-2 ( port for switch in our example to allowed trunk vlan on it)
switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,10,20,30,40,50,60,70
do wr
exit
